## Title: Forward Modeling and Machine Learning as Tools for Making Meaningful Comparisons Between Observations and Simulations

## Brainstorming

* Transforming model results to "observable" quantities
  * T,n -> I(lambda)
  * I(lambda) -> a, timelag
* Analyzing a sufficient amount of data to make a meaningful comparison
* Quantifying agreement between model and data
  * Distributions of observables
  * Machine learning

Focus on three different aspects:

* Quantitative comparisons between observations and models (What will machine learning help us do?)
* Incorporating multiple diagnostics in these quantitative comparisons (maybe this is combined with the point above)
* How do the properties of the heating vary over a single AR? (i.e. look at more than a pixel)

## Future

* How do the properties of the heating vary from one AR to the next? or with age (e.g. one rotation to the next)?

## Skeleton

* Lay out the problem: Want to connect models to observations to constrain frequency of energy distribution
  * Data
  * Forward model
  * Bridge (i.e. comparison tool) 
* Describe the diagnostics: EM distribution (and slope), time lag, (hot plasma)
  * These quantities hold information about the frequency of energy deposition
